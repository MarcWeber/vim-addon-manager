# VAM — maximizing overall Vim experience

“VAM” is short name for vim-addon-manager.

You declare a set of plugins, and VAM will fetch & activate them at startup or
runtime depending on your needs. Activating means handling runtimepath and
making sure all .vim files get sourced. See the [FEATURES](#features) section
to learn more.

![VAM](http://vam.mawercer.de/screenshot.png)

This screenshot shows:

- The log buffer
- The plugin name completion
- That vim-pi knows about plugins which are neither known by vim-scripts.org
  nor by vim.sf.net (marked by `NA`)

## If you believe in VAM's collaborative properties

then you may also want to have a look at [vim-git-wiki](http://vim-wiki.mawercer.de).

## SUPPORT / HELP

VAM is well supported by at least 2 maintainers. Try github tickets or the Vim
irc channel on freenode.

## PLUGIN_NAME - What is a plugin ?

A plugin is set of files having Vim's rtp directory layout (`plugin/`,
`ftplugin/`, ...).  It is identified by name which will be looked up by vim-pi
or a url such as `git:url`, `github:user/repo`, ...

Plugin names can be found by using `<c-x><c-p>` completion in `.vim` files.
VAMActivate & VAMPluginInfo commands also offer name completion by `<tab>` or
`<c-d>`.

In most cases you activate plugins by using its name. Wrapping the name
in a dictionary `{'name': 'name'}` allows attaching additional information
which could be used by checkout functions ...

## MINIMAL setup (3 lines)

```vim
set nocompatible | filetype indent plugin on | syn on
set runtimepath+=/path/to/vam
call vam#ActivateAddons([PLUGIN_NAME])
```

## Recommended setup

This setup will checkout VAM and all plugins on its own unless they exist:

```vim
" put this line first in ~/.vimrc
set nocompatible | filetype indent plugin on | syn on

fun! SetupVAM()
  let c = get(g:, 'vim_addon_manager', {})
  let g:vim_addon_manager = c
  let c.plugin_root_dir = expand('$HOME', 1) . '/.vim/vim-addons'

  " Force your ~/.vim/after directory to be last in &rtp always:
  " let g:vim_addon_manager.rtp_list_hook = 'vam#ForceUsersAfterDirectoriesToBeLast'

  " most used options you may want to use:
  " let c.log_to_buf = 1
  " let c.auto_install = 0
  let &rtp.=(empty(&rtp)?'':',').c.plugin_root_dir.'/vim-addon-manager'
  if !isdirectory(c.plugin_root_dir.'/vim-addon-manager/autoload')
    execute '!git clone --depth=1 git://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager '
        \       shellescape(c.plugin_root_dir.'/vim-addon-manager', 1)
  endif

  " This provides the VAMActivate command, you could be passing plugin names, too
  call vam#ActivateAddons([], {})
endfun
call SetupVAM()

" ACTIVATING PLUGINS

" OPTION 1, use VAMActivate
VAMActivate PLUGIN_NAME PLUGIN_NAME ..

" OPTION 2: use call vam#ActivateAddons
call vam#ActivateAddons([PLUGIN_NAME], {})
" use <c-x><c-p> to complete plugin names

" OPTION 3: Create a file ~/.vim-scripts putting a PLUGIN_NAME into each line
" See lazy loading plugins section in README.md for details
call vam#Scripts('~/.vim-scripts', {'tag_regex': '.*'})

```

## easy setup windows users:

Give the [downloader](http://vam.mawercer.de/) a try if you're too lazy to
install supporting tools. In the `doc/` directory you'll find additional
information. https (self signed certificate) can be used, too.

## all commands

```vim
" Note: All commands support completion (<c-d> or <tab>)

" install [UE] without activating for reviewing
VAMInstall PLUGIN_NAME PLUGIN_NAME

" install [UE], then activate
VAMActivate P1 P2 ...
VAMActivateInstalled (same, but completion is limited to installed plugins)

" find plugins by name github url or script id and display all information
VAMPluginInfo script_id or characters to match any description against

" update plugins (by name or all you're using right now) - you should restart Vim afterwards:
VAMUpdate vim-pi P1 P2
VAMUpdateActivated

VAMListActivated
VAMUninstallNotLoadedPlugins P1 P2

" [UE]: unless the directory exists
" P1 P2 represents arbitrary plugin names, use <c-x><c-p> to complete in .vim files

" If you need a plugin to be activated immediately. Example: You require a command in your .vimrc:
call vam#ActivateAddons(['P1', P2'], {'force_loading_plugins_now': 1})
" (should we create a special command for this?)
```

Also: Of course VAM allows using subdirectories of repositories as runtimepath.
Eg See vim-pi-patching.

## lazily loading plugins / tag plugins by topic / pass dictionaries for adding arbitrary options

You can tag plugins and load them lazily

```vim
let scripts = []
call add(scripts, {'names': ['plugin_for_c_1', 'plugin_for_c_2'], 'tag': 'c-dev'})
call add(scripts, {'name': 'plugin_ruby', 'tag': 'ruby-dev'})
" must activate by filename because .pov filetype is known after the script
" script-povray got activated
call add(scripts, {'name': 'script-povray', 'filename_regex':'\.pov$'})
" for others ft_regex can be used:
call add(scripts, {'name': 'script-php', 'ft_regex':'^\.php$'})

" always activate this color scheme, and set runtimepath
call add(scripts, {'name': 'github:daylerees/colour-schemes', 'addon-info': {'runtimepath': 'vim'} })

" just activate a rtp (also works at runtime with all hooks such as sourcing ftdetect/*.vim files)
call add(scripts, {'activate_this_rtp': 'absolute-rtp-path'})


" tell VAM about all scripts, and immediately activate plugins having the c-dev tag:
call vam#Scripts(scripts, {'tag_regex': 'c-dev'})

" activate all tagged scripts immediately
call vam#Scripts([], {'tag_regex': '.*'})
```

Instead of adding dictionaries to a local list you can make VAM read them from a
file as show at [vim-wiki's plugin management
article](http://vim-wiki.mawercer.de/wiki/topic/vim%20plugin%20managment.html)

Having a declarative list of plugins you might be using allows

 * implementing a garbage collector
 * implementing third party update/checkout scripts which run checkout in parallel
 * reusing such interface by other plugin managers

## How does VAM know about dependencies?

Plugins ship with addon-info.json files listing the dependencies as names
(eventually with source location). Those who don't get patched by vim-pi.

Only mandatory dependencies should be forced this way. Optional dependencies
should still be installed/activated by you.


## emulating vundle

NOTE: VAM is declarative. Thus Bundle behaves like VAMActivate:

 1. checkout plugin unless directory exists
 2. activate it

Thus there is no reason to run `:BundleInstall` or such (what for anyway?)

```vim
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vim-addon-manager/
call vundle#rc()
Bundle fugitive
VAMActivate by-name-and-pull-depenedencies
```

Emulation is not complete yet. If you want us to complete it (eg implement the
second `{rtp: ..}` create a github issue. Its obsolete, because vim-pi is very
likely to know about it if you install by name.

## learn more

- by skimming this README.md file
- by looking at headlines at
  [doc/\*getting-started.txt](https://raw.github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/master/doc/vim-addon-manager-getting-started.txt).
  (Note: this is best read in Vim with `:set ft=help`)

## FEATURES

- Declarative: The behaviour of Vim is determined by your `.vimrc` only. [1]
- Automatic runtimepath handling: install/ update/ use manually installed addons
  on startup or load them lazily as needed when you feel that way. [3]
- Builtin dependency management. [2]
- Based on a [pool](http://vam.mawercer.de) of addons which is maintained by the
  community. This allows warning you if you’re going to install outdated
  packages. Of course you can opt-out and use your own pool easily.
- Sources from www.vim.org, git, mercurial, subversion, bazaar, darcs, [...]
- Addon name completion in `.vim` files and `:(Update|Activate)Addons` commands.
- Short syntax for github repos: `github:name/repo`.
- Optionally writes update logs.
- Cares about [windows users](http://mawercer.de/~marc/vam/index.php).
- Addon info by name or script id (`:AddonInfo`).
- Tries to preserve user modifications by using diff/patch tools on unix like
  environments (for non-version-controlled sources).
- 100 % VimL (is this really that good?..)
- The VimL code which gets started each time is contained in one file: vam.vim
  (700 loc). Everything else has carefully been put into additional supporting
  files.

[1]: assuming you always use latest versions

[2]: this serves the community by making it easy to reuse other’s code.
     Implemented by a addon-info.json file and patchinfo database for addons
     without VAM support.

[3]: Yes — there are some special cases where it does not work correctly because
     some autocommands don’t get triggered

[4]: Plugin authors should use addon-info file instead. patchinfo.vim is for
     addons not supporting VAM.

## Let me see all docs!

## BUGS

It’ll never have nice install progress bars — because the “progress” is not very
well known because addons can be installed at any time — and additional
dependencies may be encountered.

If you want to be able to rollback you have to use git submodules yourself or
find a different solution — because VAM also supports other VCS and installing
from archives. We have implemented an experimental setup, but because VAM may
add additional files such as addon-info.json in some cases repositories look
dirty usually.

VAM does not support parallel installation yet (Like
[NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)) - we think dependencies
are more important. If you feel strongly about this create a issue.  This would
require rewriting quite a lot of code.

Each call of VAMActivate takes about 1ms - if that's too slow, pass many plugin
names at once.
