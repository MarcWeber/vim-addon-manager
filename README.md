# VAM — maximizing overall Vim experience
“VAM” is short name for vim-addon-manager.
You declare a set of plugins. VAM will fetch & activate them at startup or
runtime depending on your needs. Activating means handling runtimepath and
making sure all .vim file get sourced.

## If you believe in VAM's collaborative properties
then you may also want to have a look at [vim-git-wiki](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-git-wiki)
If you contribute to this git based wiki editable by Vim we have a chance
making it official ot www.vim.org.


## MINIMAL setup (2 lines)

    set runtimepath+=/path/to/vam
    call vam#ActivateAddons([list of addon names])

Keep reading to get an overview about VAM.

## NEED MORE INFO?

Skim this README.md file, look at the documentation at doc/ which will tell you
how to contact us.

## FEATURES
- Declarative: The behaviour of Vim is determined by your .vimrc only. [1]
- Automatic runtimepath handling: install/ update/ use manually installed addons 
  on startup or load them lazily as needed when you feel that way. [3]
- Builtin dependency management. [2]
- Based on a [pool](http://mawercer.de/~marc/vam/index.php) of addons which is 
  maintained by the community. This allows warning you if you’re going to 
  install outdated packages. Of course you can opt-out and use your own pool 
  easily.
- Sources from www.vim.org, git, mercurial, subversion, bazaar, darcs, [...]
- Addon name completion in .vim files and :(Update|Activate)Addons commands.
- Short syntax for github repos: `github:name/repo`.
- Optionally writes update logs.
- Cares about [windows users](http://mawercer.de/~marc/vam/index.php).
- Addon info by name or script id (:AddonInfo).
- Tries to preserve user modifications by using diff/patch tools on unix like
  environments (for non-version-controlled sources).
- 100 % VimL (is this really that good?..)

[1]: assuming you always use latest versions

[2]: this serves the community by making it easy to reuse other’s code. 
     Implemented by a addon-info.json file and patchinfo database for addons 
     without VAM support.

[3]: Yes — there are some special cases where it does not work correctly because 
     some autocommands don’t get triggered

## THE POOL
Pool is made up of

- [Plugins found on 
  www.vim.org](https://raw.github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager-known-repositories/master/db/vimorgsources.json).
  List is updated by a cron job.
- [Version controlled and non-www.vim.org 
  sources](https://raw.github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager-known-repositories/master/db/scmsources.vim). 
  They are added manually, you can file a pull request if you want to add one.
- [File with additional 
  information](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager-known-repositories/blob/master/db/patchinfo.vim)
  augmenting sources: it has information with dependencies [4], corrects addon 
  types and contains deprecations.

[4]: Plugin authors should use addon-info file instead. patchinfo.vim is for 
     addons not supporting VAM.

## SUPPORT
VAM is well supported by at least 2 maintainers. Try github tickets or Vim irc
channel on freenode.

However the “self install” alternative is recommended, see 
[section 2 of GETTING STARTED](https://raw.github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/master/doc/vim-addon-manager-getting-started.txt)

## CONTACT / HELP
See contact information in GETTING STARTED documentation.

## BUGS
It’ll never have nice install progress bars — because the “progress” is not very 
well known because addons can be installed at any time — and additionall 
dependencies may be encountered.

If you want to be able to rollback you have to use git submodules yourself or 
find a different solution — because VAM also supports other VCS and installing 
from archives.
