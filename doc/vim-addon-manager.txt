1. Intro                                           *vim-addon-manager-intro*

This plugin allows users to install and uninstall plugins with a minimum of 
work. Features:

    - Separate directories for each plugins
    - Dependency resolution
    - Popular VCS support: plugin supports fetching from Mercurial, Git and 
      Subversion repositories

Dependencies:
    - Curl, wget or other program that can output URL contents to stdout (in 
      order to get http protocol support)
    - Mercurial, Git and Subversion (if you want to install plugins from 
      appropriate repositories)
    - vcs_checkouts plugin (comes with this addon)
    - Tar, gzip and zip (required for unpacking some addons)

2. Installation                             *vim-addon-manager-installation*

Windows users: see |vim-addon-manager-windows|.
Gentoo users: see |vim-addon-manager-gentoo|.

1. Create a separate directory that will hold your plugins, for example 
   ~/vim-addons The addon manager intentionally installs each addon
   into its own directory which is not ~/.vim .
2. Install vim-addon-manager to ~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager. If you use 
   git, you should do the following: >
        cd ~/vim-addons
        git clone git://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager.git
<  Git will create ~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager for you.
3. Add ~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager to your runtimepath by adding the 
   following lines to your vimrc: >
        fun ActivateAddons()
          set runtimepath+=~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager
          try
            call scriptmanager#Activate([])
          catch /.*/
            echoe v:exception
          endtry
        endf
        call ActivateAddons()
        " experimental: run after gui has been started
        " report breakage in this case, please
        " au GUIEnter * call Activate()

3. Functionality provided                  *vim-addon-manager-functionality*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Commands                                   *vim-addon-manager-commands*

ActivateAddons {name} ...                                  *:ActivateAddons*
        Activate addons with given names. See |scriptmanager#Activate()| for 
        more details.

ActivateInstalledAddons {name} ...                *:ActivateInstalledAddons*
        See |:ActivateAddons|, this command is just the same, but completion 
        function completes only installed addon names.

UpdateAddons [{name} ...]                                    *:UpdateAddons*
        Update addons with given names. Without arguments updates all addons. 
        See |scriptmanager2#Update()| for more details.

UninstallNotLoadedAddons {name} ...              *:UninstallNotLoadedAddons*
        Unistall addons with given names. See 
        |scriptmanager2#UninstallAddons()| for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. Functions                                 *vim-addon-manager-functions*

scriptmanager#Activate([{name}, ...])             *scriptmanager#Activate()*
        Activates addons with given names. Used by |:ActivateAddons|.
        Note: This is probably all you need.
        Second note: [{name}, ...] in arguments means that you should pass 
        a list of strings, not that {name} is optional. Typical calls (both 
        are equivalent): >
            call scriptmanager#Activate([
              \ "name1",
              \ "name2",
              \ ])
            call scriptmanager#Activate(
              \ "name1",
              \ "name2"
              \ )
<
        Activating a plugin means that function will do the following steps:
        0. Check, whether requested addon is already installed. If not, 
           install it.
        1. Activate plugins that are mentioned in dependencies dictionary (see 
           |addon-info-dependencies|)
        2. Add plugin runtime directory to 'runtimepath' option
        3. Check whether vim has already started. If it was then source first 
           all files under addon's plugin directory, then under after/plugin 
           directory. If it was not, then wait until vim loads and source 
           files under addon's after/plugin directory (Vim does not sources 
           them in this case by default).
        Note that in order to bring installed plugins to work, you need to add 
        the following line to your vimrc: >
            call scriptmanager#Activate([List_of_all_addons_you_need])

scriptmanager2#Install([{arg}])                   *scriptmanager2#Install()*
        Installs plugins from the given list. Each {arg} may be one the 
        following:
            - Name of the plugin
            - Path to |addon-info.txt| file (it must contain at least one 
              forward or back slash, so use `./plugname-addon-info.txt' for 
              files located in the current directory)i
            - |addon-info.txt| URL. In this case {arg} must start with 
              `http://'.
        After installing the plugin help tags are updated, see |:helptags|.

scriptmanager2#Update([{name}])                    *scriptmanager2#Update()*
        Updates plugins with given names. If an empty list is given, then 
        updates all plugins. Note that it is able to update only those plugins 
        that were fetched by VCS. scriptmanager2#Update also updates the help 
        tags.

scriptmanager#AddonInfo({name})                  *scriptmanager#AddonInfo()*
        Returns dictionary that contains information given in |addon-info.txt| 
        file that comes with requested addon. If no |addon-info.txt| file is 
        present, it is not readable or addon with given name is not installed, 
        then it returns empty dictionary.

                                          *scriptmanage2#MergePluginFiles()*
scriptmanager2#MergePluginFiles([{name}] [, blacklist-regex ])
        Highly experimental function that may speed up vim start on heavy IO 
        load. This function renames all `plugin' directories to 
        contents into `~/.vim/after/plugin/vim-addon-manager-merged.vim' which 
        should cause less IO stress to your system, thus Vim will startup 
        faster. This can scripts because:
            - s:... script global variables are renamed automatically to
              prevent name clashes
            - Guards are replaced by if ... endif which might be inefficient
            - `finish' statement that start line and every line after them are 
              just commented out

        Using the blacklist-regex you can filter plugin/*.vim files and
        prevent them from being included. For example this excludes many tlib
        plugins.: >

            let s:merge = [ "tlib" ]
            call scriptmanager#Activate(s:merge)
            command MergePluginFiles call scriptmanager2#MergePluginFiles(s:merge+["tlib"], '\%(cmdlinehelp\|concordance\|evalselection\|glark\|hookcursormoved\|linglang\|livetimestamp\|localvariables\|loremipsum\|my_tinymode\|pim\|quickfixsigns\|scalefont\|setsyntax\|shymenu\|spec\|tassert\|tbak\|tbibtools\|tcalc\|tcomment\|techopair\|tgpg\|tmarks\|tmboxbrowser\|tortoisesvn\|tregisters\|tselectbuffer\|tselectfile\|tsession\|tskeleton\|tstatus\|viki\|vikitasks\)\.vim_merged')
            command UnmergePluginFiles call scriptmanager2#UnmergePluginFiles()
<

        Yes, the info files should be cached as well (TODO)

==============================================================================
4. Options                                      *vim-addon-manager-options*
                                                     *g:vim_script_manager*

All options are located in the global dictionary g:vim_script_manager. It also 
contains some stuff that user should never modify if he wants to see this 
plugin working. Possible keys:

auto_install                               *vim-addon-manager-auto_install*
        This options disables plugin installation confirmation. It will not 
        disable deprecation warnings and other prompts.
plugin_sources                           *vim-addon-manager-plugin_sources*
        This option contains a dictionary where keys are plugin names and 
        values are described by |addon-info-repository|. Values defined in 
        this dictionary override corresponding values in |addon-info.txt| 
        files, so be careful when you extend it.
plugin_root_dir                         *vim-addon-manager-plugin_root_dir*
        Defines a directory where plugins will be installed to. If 
        autoload/scriptmanager.vim file that comes with this plugin is 
        writeable by user, then it defaults to the directory three levels up 
        relative to autoload/scriptmanager.vim (so, if user has installed 
        vim-addon-manager to ~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager, this will be 
        equal to ~/vim-addons). If autoload/scriptmanager.vim is not writeable 
        by the user, then it defaults to ~/vim-addons. Note that you must set 
        this variable before calling any scriptmanager function.

==============================================================================
5. Installing plugins                   *vim-addon-manager-install-plugins*

First read |vim-addon-manager-installation|.

As documented |scriptmanager#Activate| or |:ActivateAddons| will fetch
(=install) the plugin if it failed to find requested addon in your addons 
directory.

You can use |:ActivateAddons|'s tab completion to find the plugin name fast.

Usually you add the names of the addons this way to your .vimrc: >
   set runtimepath+=~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager
   call scriptmanager#Activate(["pluginA","pluginB"])
<
You can use the Install function to install plugins only - however in practise
you use the Activate command / function only.

You can install plugins by URL. See |scriptmanager2#Install()|.
I prefer you telling me about your repository location, though.
Also see |vim-addon-manager-repository-locations|.

Implementation details: ~
Vim does not source plugin/*.vim and after/plugin/*.vim automatically
if you add pathes to runtimepath after Vim has startup. vim-addon-manager
takes care of that for you.


==============================================================================
6. Addon-info file                           *vim-addon-manager-addon-info*
                                                           *addon-info.txt*

Each plugin that intends to use vim-addon-manager for distributing itself 
needs to have {plugname}-addon-info.txt file in its root, that contains the 
JSON dictionary with the following keys (none of the keys are required):

name                                                      *addon-info-name*
        Name of the plugin. Must not contain any characters that cannot be 
        used in a directory name (including directory names separator).
        Note that if the value of this key, {plugname} part in addon-info.txt 
        file name and directory under which plugin is installed are not equal, 
        then user that tries to use your plugin may catch strange bugs.

repository                                          *addon-info-repository*
        Describes where the plugin should be fetched from. Ignored unless the 
        plugin is installed using either the second or third form of 
        |scriptmanager2#Install()| call (see its description). This is 
        a dictionary with the following keys:

         !! Note: As very common in extreme programming documentation may be
         !! outdated. So may be this section. So refer to the code:
         !! |scriptmanager2#Checkout()| to find out about all supported keys
         !! Its easy to read and extend. Contact me if you're unsure. I'll help
         !! you.
         !! I'd even consider moving this section into the code only refering
         |! to it - so that its kept in sync.

        Key      Description ~
        type     Required, must be either one of `hg', `git', `svn' or an 
                 empty string.
        url      If `type' key contains a VCS name (`hg', `git' or `svn'), 
                 then this key describes a url that will be passed to this 
                 VCS. If `type' key contains an empty string, then it should 
                 contain location of the archive.
        script-type
                 One of `plugin', `syntax', or `indent'. The .vim file will be 
                 moved into the specific subdirectory.
        archive_name
                 If `type' key contains an empty string, then archive which 
                 location is described by the `url' key will be saved in file 
                 with name {archive_name} and processed according to its 
                 extension. Supported extensions:
                 Extension     How it is handled ~
                 .vim          This extension designates that plugin is a single 
                               file. So, if exists key `script-type' and it is 
                               equal to `syntax' or `indent', then this file 
                               is put under {plugname}/syntax or under 
                               {plugname}/indent, otherwise it is put under 
                               directory described by {plugname}/{target_dir} 
                               (where {target_dir} is a value of `target_dir' 
                               key if it is present and `plugin' otherwise).
                .tar.gz, .tgz  This extension designates that plugin is 
                               contained inside tar archive compressed by 
                               gzip. In this case, archive is unpacked to its 
                               directory by `tar' (note that it must support 
                               -z option), {N} components are stripped before 
                               unpacking (here {N} is defined by 
                               `strip-components' key if it is present, 
                               default value 1. See tar man page for more 
                               information).
                .tar.bz2, .tbz2
                               Like .tar.gz, but with bzip2 compression. Note 
                               that your tar must support -j option or it 
                               won't work.
                .tar           This extension designates that plugin is 
                               contained inside uncompressed tar archive. In 
                               this case, archive is unpacked to its directory 
                               by `tar', {N} components are stripped before 
                               unpacking (here {N} is defined by 
                               `strip-components' key if it is present, 
                               default value 1. See tar man page for more 
                               information).
                .zip           This extension designates that plugin is 
                               contained inside a zip archive. In this case 
                               archive is unpacked to its directory by 
                               `unzip'.
                .7z, .rar, .cab, .arj, .jar
                               This extension designates that plugin is 
                               contained inside an archive that is supported 
                               by p7zip archiver. In this case archive is 
                               unpacked to its directory by `7z x'.
                .vba           This extension designates that plugin is 
                               contained in a vimball archive. In this case 
                               vimball#Vimball() function is used, see 
                               |:UseVimball| for more details.
                .vba.gz        This extension designates that plugin is 
                               contained in a vimball archive compressed by 
                               gzip. In this case archive is uncompressed and 
                               vimball#Vimball() function is used, see 
                               |:UseVimball| for more details.
                .vba.bz2       Like .vba.bz2, but with bzip2 compression.
        deprecated
                If this key is present and contains non-empty string, then 
                every time when user tries to install this plugin he will see 
                this message and will have to confirm installation.

dependencies                                      *addon-info-dependencies*
        Describes plugins that are required for the plugin, must contain 
        a dictionary where keys are plugin names and values describe where 
        appropriate plugins should be fetched from (overriden by 
        |vim-addon-manager-plugin_sources|). The format of the values is the 
        same as |addon-info-repository|.

List of known repositories is defined in a separate plugin called 
|vim-addon-manager-known-repositories|. If you want your plugin to be added to 
this list, then contact the author. Note that this list is also populated 
automatically from www.vim.org site, so sometimes you do not need to do 
anything.

As alternative you can specify them in your .vimrc like what that plugin is 
doing: Add your own dicts to: >
    g:vim_script_manager['plugin_sources']['your-plugin-name'] = { ... }
<
In your .vimrc or somewhere else (see |vim-addon-manager-plugin_sources|).

There are also some other package managers for vim:
    http://github.com/c9s/Vimana
    http://snk.tuxfamily.org/log/vim-script-management-system.html
You can try and see which is the best.

There is another project which has the same name:
http://packages.debian.org/sid/vim-addon-manager
The author (Jamessan) is fine with this project sharing the same name.

(Incomplete list):
Tim Pope 
  - Json validation
ZyX (Nikolay Pavlov, ZyX-I on github)
  - enhancing this vim documentation
  - various fixes
  - discussing implementation details
  - initial implementation for updating plugins which were installed by
    archive

Mike Smullin:
 - for asking to find a way to source addons when gui is running.
   There is a hint now. This is important if you don't start vim from console


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROADMAP:

What features are missing?

- When updating archive based plugins create diffs so that you can patch
  those files without changes being lost. I expect users to customize mappings
  and such

- add a command like AddonManagerFetchUtils which does all the work listed in
  9. for you putting the tar etc into a directory and adding it to PATH

- suggestions?

8. Testing this plugin                           *vim-addon-manager-testing*

Run >
    # Replace ~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager with the path you installed this 
    # plugin to
    cd ~/vim-addons/vim-addon-manager
    sh vim-addon-manager-test.sh
.
You should see >

    1
    1
at the end. Written for Linux only. Code coverage is bad. Its a starting
point.

9. Some notes for windows users                  *vim-addon-manager-windows*



Win32 tools for vim-addon-manager

Fast: put curl into ~/vim-addons/binary-utils/dist then call this function
to setup the remaining tools (tar, bzip, gzip, unzip) >
    call scriptmanager2#FetchAdditionalWindowsTools()
<
If 7z is in PATH bzip, unzip, gzip are not pulled. So consider installing that
and add it to PATH by >
      let $PATH=$PATH.';'.PATH_TO_7z
<

( TODO: test it, provide a way to install 7z instead? )

Does it make sense to support svn and git this way as well?
Is it even possible?
At least we can fetch and execute the installers..

Section provided by creidiki:

Curl:
    Get Curl here: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

    1. Scroll down to the end of the "Packages" list. You want (ideally) the 
       latest version, of type `binary' (not libcurl or devel). SSL is not 
       necessary but won't hurt. If your OS is 64-bit, you can get the Win64 
       version if you want, but it won't be any faster.
    2. Install it. Then point vim-addon-manager (and, incidentally, netrw) to 
       it by putting something like this in your _vimrc: >
           let g:netrw_http_cmd='{path_to_curl}\curl.exe -o'
<      (replace {path-to-curl} with the installation directory, including the 
       brackets).

    Don't forget the -o argument at the end. :)

Archives:
    Get Tar, Gzip and Unzip from the GnuWin32 project
    Gzip: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gzip.htm
    Tar: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gtar.htm
    Unzip: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/unzip.htm

    Either get the complete package setups, or the binary installers. All you 
    need is the binaries.
    Install or unpack them somewhere.

    Get xzdec here: http://nullprogram.com/blog/2010/04/16/
    or here: http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/xzutils.zip
    You only need xzdec.exe. Put in the same place you put those other archive 
    tools.

    Get p7zip here: http://7-zip.org/download.html. You need the full version 
    with gui because package with command-line version contains only 7za 
    executable, while you need 7z in order to support more archives.

    Either add them to your system or user path (google it!) or add them just 
    to vim's path by putting something like this in _vimrc: >
        let $PATH='{path-to-gnu-utils};'.$PATH
<   Again, replace the whole of {path-to-gnu-utils} including brackets with 
    the directory you have installed/unpacked them to.

VCS:
    MSysGit (and TortoiseGit/GitExtensions) by default add the `git' 
    executable to your PATH. If you chose not to for whatever reason, you can 
    use the trick above to let vim see them. TortoiseHG does the same with the 
    mercurial `hg' executable. TortoiseSVN does not include the commandline 
    `svn' executable, so if you need it install SilkSVN

    SilkSVN: http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download/
    MsysGit: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
    Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

10. Some notes for Gentoo users                  *vim-addon-manager-gentoo*

Gentoo users may consider installing this plugin from pluginloader overlay 
which is accessible via mercurial, url: 
http://vimpluginloader.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/vimpluginloader/pluginloader-overlay

In order to use this overlay paludis users can add the pluginloader.conf file 
to /etc/paludis/repositories/ with the following contents: >
    location = /var/paludis/repositories/pluginloader
    format = e
    sync = hg+http://vimpluginloader.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/vimpluginloader/pluginloader-overlay

    master_repository = gentoo
    names_cache = ${location}/.cache/names
    write_cache = /var/cache/paludis/metadata

Then you should unmask app-vim/vim-addon-manager and run >
    paludis --sync && paludis --install vim-addon-manager
or >
    cave sync && cave resolve -x vim-addon-manager
and everything will probably be fine.

For portage+layman users:
1. Create a file /var/lib/layman/pluginloader-overlay.xml with the following 
   contents: >
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE repositories SYSTEM "/dtd/repositories.dtd">
        <repositories xmlns="" version="1.0">
          <repo quality="experimental" status="unofficial">
            <name>pluginloader-overlay</name>
            <description>Overlay that contains some additional vim plugins</description>
            <source type="mercurial">http://vimpluginloader.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/vimpluginloader/pluginloader-overlay</source>
          </repo>
        </repositories>
2. Add the following line to /etc/layman/layman.cfg just after the line that 
   starts with `overlays' (do not forget to indent it, see comment above the 
   target line): >
                file:///var/lib/layman/pluginloader-overlay.xml
3. Run >
        layman -ka pluginloader-overlay
4. Unmask vim-addon-manager and run >
        emerge vim-addon-manager

*marc-weber-vim-addon-manager-design-notes*

Until now I tried following the "New Jersey", KISS, MIT principles:
- Try to achieve 80% of value by spending 20% of effort
- I consider this piece of code being perfect if there is nothing you can
  remove.
- If it behaves ok in 95% of all use cases its good enough (for me)
  because I prefer a minimal code base.

ZyX created a branch which tries to be accurate summarrized by quoting him:
"I am trying to get rid of as much future errors as possible".
See related work to get it instead of this. Lets watch it and be curious about
what's going to happen.

11. Trouble shooting & KNOWS BUGS       *vim-addon-manage-trouble-shooting*

Don't have those commands? See |vim-addon-manager-installation|.
Windows installation is more tedious than on Linux - yes.

Still trouble? Get in touch, see |vim-addon-manager-author|

You have to trust script authors:
Because everybody can upload everything to the repositories (in particular 
www.vim.org) you must trust authors. I can't review all code - so expect code 
to steal your passwords, run sudo rm -fr / ... etc. (This never happened to 
me. But it could)
Briefly: I'm not responsible for the code you get using vim-addon-manager.

If something goes wrong - and if I don't reply within 24h:
The following github users are collaborators. This means they have write 
access to the official repository:
tpope, dertuxmalwieder, TuxTom.

If a plugin behaves strangely then try 
http://github.com/dahu/VimLint/blob/master/plugin/vimlint.vim.
Maybe you have an uncommon Vim setting causing some plugins to fail.
